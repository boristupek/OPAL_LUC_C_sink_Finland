# OPAL_LUC_C_sink_Finland
This is reproducible R soil carbon modelling analysis of the study on "Carbon sink of land use change by mineral soil cropland extensification and afforestation can offset only a small fraction of national CO2 emissions in a boreal region" by Tupek et al. 2020. The repository includes the Yasso07 model, input data (climate, forest growth, and agricultural production) and the scrits for running the simulations and oututing the results. boris.tupek@luke.fi

The code simulates the soil organic carbon (SOC) developement and draws the figures for land use types (agricultural land in future continuous cultivation versus afforested agricultural land) under alternative managements represented by the land use change scenarios (deforestation and cultivation in the past, future land use scenarios 1) continuous cultivation of cropland and grassland, 2) extensification of cropland to grassland, and 3) afforestation by Norway spruce or Silver birch tree species).
