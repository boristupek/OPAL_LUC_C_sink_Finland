# OPAL_LUC_C_sink_Finland
An R code with an input data (climate, forest growth, and agricultural production) for soil carbon modelling with the Yasso07 model to replicate the analysis of the study on "Carbon sink potential of land use change in Finland" by Tupek et al. 2020, boris.tupek@luke.fi

The code simulates the soil organic carbon (soc) developement and draws the figures for land use types (agricultural land in future continuous cultivation versus afforested agricultural land) under alternative managements represented by the land use change scenarios (deforestation, cultivation, continuous cultivation of cropland and grassland, extensification of cropland to grassland, and afforestation by Norway spruce or Silver birch tree species).
